Some notes on specific bingo tiles:

- An **easy boss** means one of Leader Shigenori Yamauchi, Mist Noble, or Okami Leader Shizu, no
  matter where they appear. If the randomizer is set to "scale up/down enemy health/damage", any
  miniboss in Ashina Outskirts is also considered **easy**.

- You _may_ count minibosses in the Folding Screen Monkeys fight towards miniboss challenges,
  including "kill X &lt;type&gt;s" and "kill both &lt;type&gt;s".

- "Matched pairs" of memory bosses include both Owls, both Apes, both Isshins, both Lady
  Butterflies, and both Monks. It does _not_ include two Genichiros, because there are three total
  in the game. You may count the memory boss from the tutorial if you manage to kill it.

- "Without resting" includes anything that causes enemies to respawn, such as dying, fast traveling,
  using Homeward Idol, and so on.
