A bingo generator website for randomized video games.

This repo aims to be three things:

- A library for designing bingo board randomizers, with enough expressiveness to provide deep and
  replayable randomizer bingo experiences.

- A collection of design principles for randomizer bingo boards to make the experience of actual
  play as fun and exciting as possible.

- A website that hosts the bingo board generation to make it easy for players to get new bingo
  boards to run against.

It does _not_ intend to be a full-featured bingo provider itself; while it supports basic features
like marking bingo squares as completed, we recommend that you use [bingosync.com] to actually run
the bingo games.
